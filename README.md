## LatourScope

The Latourscope is a folding origami map kit based on the work of Bruno Latour on critical zones from his [Inside Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzPROcd1MuE).

He thinks the idea that we live on the vast surface of the globe of spaceship earth is deceptive, especially when trying to conceive of our ever changing ***bio-social*** and ***bio-political*** relationships to our home.

A soil scientists perspective is quite different to the mercantile globe maker; the ***critical zone*** for them is the tiny fragile vertical space that sustains human and non-human life; less than a kilometer above and below; which is more like a flat fragile veneer without which no life, no nature, no culture could exist.  

He imagines rather than sitting freely on the outside of a globe we sit comfortable (for now) ***inside*** intimate relations of microbiological soil systems & multitudes of dead and living plants and animals. We all know this veneer could be in crisis.

My map takes a cartesian space from Open Street Maps and prints it beautifully on the inside of an origami lantern shape thanks to some well crafted Californian javascript.

You have to carefully cut and fold your landscape and gently blow life into it. You then peer into the inner surface; try to get your bearings! Where are we ***really***?

Why make such a difficult map? You forget every map was once difficult, it took effort and now we take it for granted. But our easy mappings control our perspectives; how do you map our relations to soil? Where is the carbon web and who is not mapping it?

What else counts as a critical zone? Soil is of course the most important thing; but this can be an inconvenient externality, as other zones like surviving UK manufacturing sites become critical. We rely on these relations also. Each map we make cuts away some relations and not others.

## Industrial Estate of Mind

What if we make industrial estates as precious as soil? I've inserted a map of indie maunfacturing below so making this map we feel ***inside*** our supply chains; but they all stack up on the microbial. We could imagine including the past silty marshlands of medieval Merseyside that made it a port for slavery and other cruel extractions made mobile.

How can we include the fragility of soil when we struggle to make ends meet in retail relations?

The [Indie Manufacturing Map](https://indie.mcqn.com/map/) map was research by MCQN Ltd on the distribution of independent makerspaces & manufacturing services in Liverpool and beyond. You can read more about the [data here](https://indie.mcqn.com/blog/2016/04/14/contributing-indie-manufacturing-data-to-open-street-map.html).

## Getting Started

I've inserted a map of indie maunfacturing, a map of not quite business as usual. When you’ve made it look up the url hidden inside 

Cut away the origami instructions and follow them carefully. Once you have completed the classic origami ‘ball’ or ‘lantern’ you will need to gently blow into the tiny hole at the end to inflate the shape. 

You should keep the printed map elements on the inside. When complete flatten it slightly and cut away the round centre, this is where you peer inside to see the map.
